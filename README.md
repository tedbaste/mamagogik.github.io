# [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com) Source Code

This is the source code of Made Mistakes, a personal blog and portfolio built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a starter I call [Skinny Bones](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll).

`images/` has been split into its [own repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-images) to reduce the size of this repo.

### Development

1. Install dependencies `bundle install`
2. Run Jekyll server to preview `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config-dev.yml --no-watch`. Good idea to disable auto-regeneration since the site is quite large and takes a few minutes to compile.
